The objective of this project is to compare various data mining techniques for detecting defaults. In a well-developed financial system, crisis management is reactive, while risk prediction is proactive. The primary goal of risk prediction is to utilize financial data—such as business financial statements, customer transaction histories, and repayment records—to forecast business performance or assess the credit risk of individual customers, thereby mitigating potential damage and uncertainty.

Data mining involves the exploration and analysis, either automatically or semi-automatically, of large datasets to uncover meaningful patterns and rules.

When a customer accepts a credit card from a bank or issuer, they agree to specific terms and conditions, including the obligation to make at least the minimum payment by the due date specified on their credit card statements. If the customer fails to meet this obligation, the issuer may classify the account as in default, impose a penalty rate, reduce the credit limit, and, in cases of significant delinquency, potentially close the account.

This project will explore and evaluate different data mining methodologies to enhance the detection of defaults, ultimately contributing to more effective risk management within financial systems.
